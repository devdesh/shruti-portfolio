# How I used Claude Code to analyze a PR to find specific files

This blog post documents the steps I followed to use Claude Code to find specific files within a GitHub Pull Request (PR). The task was to review multiple PRs for our official OCP (OpenShift Container Platform) documentation across multiple enterprise distributions. Each PR had around 80 files, making a manual review for my product, OADP (application backup and restore), very time-consuming. These steps and prompts may be helpful to anyone trying to do something similar, though you may need to modify the prompts for your specific use case.

### Step 1: Set Up Claude Code

First, set up Claude Code by following the instructions in its official documentation. To test your setup, open a terminal and type:

```claude tell me a joke```

If Claude responds with a clich√© developer joke, your setup is correct, and you're ready to proceed.

### Step 2: Connect to Your GitHub Account

Next, connect Claude to your GitHub account using the following prompt:

```claude connect to GitHub```


* Claude will run the **`gh --version`** command to check if the GitHub CLI is installed.
* If you don't have the CLI installed, Claude will provide a link to install it.
* Claude will then ask for permission to run **`gh auth login`**. Say **yes**.
* A one-time authentication code will be provided. Use the GitHub link and this code to authenticate Claude as a device on your account. You will also need your GitHub FreeOTP token to complete the process.

After authenticating, return to your terminal and confirm your connection with this prompt:

```claude am i connected to GH```


Claude should respond in the affirmative.

### Step 3: Analyze the PR

Once connected, you can start analyzing a PR. I began by providing context to Claude:

```claude I need you to analyze a PR. Should I give you the PR link?```


Next, I provided the specific PR link and my request:

```claude here is the PR link: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/****. Here is what I want you to do: Give me a list of files of the PR contained in this directory /backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore```


* Claude will run the **`gh pr view`** command and ask for your permission to proceed.
* In my case, Claude didn't find any files in that specific directory and provided a one-line summary of the PR's contents.

To ensure Claude searched thoroughly, I used a more granular prompt:

```claude analyze the PR again and give me a list of files containing any backup and restore content.```


* This time, Claude ran two **`gh pr view`** commands to use a **JQuery** and **grep** for "backup and restore" keywords.
* It successfully returned a file that contained relevant content. I verified that the file did not belong to my product, and I was satisfied with the result.

### Step 4: Analyze Multiple PRs

To analyze multiple PRs, I used a concise prompt for the remaining 7 PRs:

```claude do the same for https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/***.```


On some PRs, Claude failed to run the **`gh pr view diff`** command but seamlessly switched to using the **`gh api`** command to complete the task. This adaptability saved me a significant amount of manual effort.
