Claude Code to Find Specific Files in a GitHub PR</h1>
<p>This blog post documents the steps I followed to use Claude Code to
find specific files within a GitHub Pull Request (PR). The task was to
review multiple PRs for our official OCP (OpenShift Container Platform)
documentation across multiple enterprise distributions. Each PR had
around 80 files, making a manual review for my product, OADP
(application backup and restore), very time-consuming. These steps and
prompts may be helpful to anyone trying to do something similar, though
you may need to modify the prompts for your specific use case.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-set-up-claude-code">Step 1: Set Up Claude Code</h3>
<p>First, set up Claude Code by following the instructions in its
official documentation. To test your setup, open a terminal and
type:</p>
<p><code>claude tell me a joke</code></p>
<p>If Claude responds with a cliché developer joke, your setup is
correct, and you’re ready to proceed.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-2-connect-to-your-github-account">Step 2: Connect to Your
GitHub Account</h3>
<p>Next, connect Claude to your GitHub account using the following
prompt:</p>
<p><code>claude connect to GitHub</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Claude will run the <strong><code>gh --version</code></strong>
command to check if the GitHub CLI is installed.</li>
<li>If you don’t have the CLI installed, Claude will provide a link to
install it.</li>
<li>Claude will then ask for permission to run
<strong><code>gh auth login</code></strong>. Say
<strong>yes</strong>.</li>
<li>A one-time authentication code will be provided. Use the GitHub link
and this code to authenticate Claude as a device on your account. You
will also need your GitHub FreeOTP token to complete the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>After authenticating, return to your terminal and confirm your
connection with this prompt:</p>
<p><code>claude am i connected to GH</code></p>
<p>Claude should respond in the affirmative.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-3-analyze-the-pr">Step 3: Analyze the PR</h3>
<p>Once connected, you can start analyzing a PR. I began by providing
context to Claude:</p>
<p><code>claude I need you to analyze a PR. Should I give you the PR link?</code></p>
<p>Next, I provided the specific PR link and my request:</p>
<p><code>claude here is the PR link: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/****. Here is what I want you to do: Give me a list of files of the PR contained in this directory /backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Claude will run the <strong><code>gh pr view</code></strong> command
and ask for your permission to proceed.</li>
<li>In my case, Claude didn’t find any files in that specific directory
and provided a one-line summary of the PR’s contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure Claude searched thoroughly, I used a more granular
prompt:</p>
<p><code>claude analyze the PR again and give me a list of files containing any backup and restore content.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This time, Claude ran two <strong><code>gh pr view</code></strong>
commands to use a <strong>JQuery</strong> and <strong>grep</strong> for
“backup and restore” keywords.</li>
<li>It successfully returned a file that contained relevant content. I
verified that the file did not belong to my product, and I was satisfied
with the result.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="step-4-analyze-multiple-prs">Step 4: Analyze Multiple PRs</h3>
<p>To analyze multiple PRs, I used a concise prompt for the remaining 7
PRs:</p>
<p><code>claude do the same for https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/***.</code></p>
<p>On some PRs, Claude failed to run the
<strong><code>gh pr view diff</code></strong> command but seamlessly
switched to using the <strong><code>gh api</code></strong> command to
complete the task. This adaptability saved me a significant amount of
manual effort.</p>
